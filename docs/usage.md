- To start the program, execute `main.py`. A `LoadWindow` will open, where you either can select a File saved JSON file or use the Template.
- The `SettingsWindow` will open, where you can configure values for the Simulation. If you press "Start", the Simulation (pygame window) will start.
- The Simulation will run indefinetly, until you close the window (close window command of your operating system). Attention: the window will not close immediately, but at the end of the current generation.
- After the simulation is closed, the `SaveWindow` will open, where you can either save your configuration and quit the program ("Save"), configure the values of the current simulation and run it again ("Settings") or load a new file ("Load new File"). You can also (in all windows) quit the Program ("Quit").
